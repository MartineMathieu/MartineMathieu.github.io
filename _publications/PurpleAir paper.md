**Motivation and objective**
Fine particulate matter (PM) including PM2.5 (particles with aerodynamic diameters smaller than 2.5 Î¼m), is a well-known health risk factor (Wu et al., 2020, Wei et al., 2020; Schwartz et al., 2021). Short and long-term exposure to PM2.5 is associated with adverse health effects such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases (Pope et al., 2004; Dabass et al., 2016; Qiu et al., 2020; Ni et al., 2021), and premature deaths (Schwartz et al., 2000; Villeneuve et al., 2002; Laden et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2020, Wei et al., 2020; Schwartz et al., 2021). Precise and detailed ambient PM2.5 exposure can help to understand its distribution at fine spatial resolution, can inform mitigation plans for associated health effects (EPA, 2019; Barkjohn et al., 2020; Bi et al., 2020). Traditionally, PM2.5 exposure assessment has relied on regulatory air quality monitoring stations. However, the high instrumentation and maintenance cost of these conventional monitors has limited the monitoring network (Bi et al., 2020). 

Low-cost monitors such as PurpleAir (PA) have been developed to allow a more extended spatial variability of PM2.5 measurements (Bi et al., 2020; Tryner et al., 2020). However, the disadvantages of the low-cost sensors are uncertainties associated with the measurements, including errors related to temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) (Bi et al., 2020), and nonlinearity of errors at high concentrations (Tryner et al., 2020). PA sensors tend to overestimate PM2.5 concentrations by about 40% at high concentrations. Hygroscopic growth of particles occurs as a function of increased ambient humidity (Tryner et al., 2020; Barkjohn et al., 2020), which increases their light scattering coefficient and consequently the mass concentration (Wang et al., 2015; Barkjohn et al., 2020; Giordano et al., 202). With these uncertainties, the data quality of low-cost sensors varies with locations and atmospheric conditions. Therefore, to ensure data accuracy, calibration of low-cost sensors is crucial. A good practice is collocating conventional or regulatory air monitors with low-cost sensors in the intended deployment field (Zusman et al., 2020, Bi et al., 2020) to understand how they perform locally and be able to develop a correction model (Zusman et al., 2020, Barkjohn et al., 2020).

Our work aimed to develop a statistical modeling approach to calibrate PA sensors for deployment in Colfax, LA to collect combustion-generated PM from a commercially operated open burn/open detonation hazardous waste thermal treatment facility. The data used for the calibration were collected in Baton Rouge, LA, which has similar humidity and dew point temperature to Colfax.
