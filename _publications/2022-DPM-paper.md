**Abstract**
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention stated that people with certain underlying respiratory and cardiovascular conditions (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, asthma) might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Diesel Particulate Matter (DPM) exposure may affect the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems. The objective of the study is to assess if long-term DPM exposure was spatially associated with COVID-19 mortality across three consecutive waves (January-May, June-September, October-December) of the disease and throughout 2020. We tested a series of association models, starting with an ordinary least square (OLS) model. After observing spatial dependence in the residuals, two models designed to explore spatial dependence across the domain, a spatial lag model (SLM) and a spatial error model (SEM), and a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model designed to explore local associations, were run to analyze spatial patterns and seasonal relationships between COVID-19 mortality and long-term exposure to DPM. Positive associations were observed for the January-May and June-September waves with all three global models. The local GWR model found that associations between COVID-19 deaths and DPM concentrations may increase up to 57, 36, 43, and 58 deaths per 100,000 people in some US counties for every 1 Î¼g/m3 increase in DPM concentration for the January-May, June-September, October-December, and yearlong models. Relative significant positive association are observed in New York, New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, and western Connecticut for the wave from January to May, and in southern Florida and southern Texas for June to September. The period from October to December exhibit a negative association in most parts of the US, which seems to have influenced the year-long relationship due to the large number of deaths during that wave of the disease.
