Inclusive Excellence through Digital Learning: An Undergraduate Research Experience to Pilot Cross-Institutional Collaboration between a Historically Black University and a Predominantly White Institution
Martine Mathieu, Matilda Odera, Andrea Ofori-Boadu, Jennifer Richmond-Bryant

North Carolina State University and North Carolina State Agricultural and Technical University faculty implemented a pilot research project pairing undergraduate students from the two institutions to virtually collaborate. Our overarching goal was to understand the impact of inclusive learning practices on the perspectives and perceptions of students from different institutions and racial backgrounds by fostering close working relationships. The project involved creating shared educational and research experiences among the students. We then assessed the inclusive learning experience based on an Intercultural Knowledge and Competence rubric. Preliminary results show that the studentsâ€™ interactions became more empathetic and balanced over time.
