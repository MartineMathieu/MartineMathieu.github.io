The objective of the study was to assess if long-term DPM exposure, while accounting for potentially socio-economic confounding effects, was spatially associated with COVID-19 mortality across three consecutive waves (January-May, June-September, October-December) of the disease and throughout 2020. We tested a series of association models, starting with an ordinary least square model. After observing spatial dependence in the residuals, a spatial lag model and a spatial error model, and a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model were run to analyze spatial patterns and seasonal relationships between COVID-19 mortality and long-term exposure to DPM.
