I am a Ph.D Student in [Geospatial Analytics](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/) at North Carolina State University, advised by [Dr. Jennifer Richmond-Bryant](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/directory/jennifer-richmond-bryant). My research project consists of performing spatial and statistical modeling of PM size distribution and concentrations of components including EPFRs to understand the spatial extent of contaminant exposures.

Currently, as an [KC Donnelly award winner (2022)](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/supported/centers/srp/training/donnelly/index.cfm), I'm doing an externship at the Iowa Superfund Research Center. My work at [Dr. Keri Hornbuckle lab](https://hornbuckle.lab.uiowa.edu/current-projects)focuses on AERMOD predictive modeling to assess exposure to airborne PCBs at the Portland Harbor.
