I am a Ph.D Student in [Geospatial Analytics](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/) at North Carolina State University, advised by [Dr. Jennifer Richmond-Bryant](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/directory/jennifer-richmond-bryant). My current work consists of performing spatial and statistical modeling of PM size distribution and concentrations of components including EPFRs to understand the spatial extent of contaminant exposures.
