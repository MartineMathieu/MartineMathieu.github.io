I am a Ph.D Student in [Geospatial Analytics](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/) at North Carolina State University, advised by [Dr. Jennifer Richmond-Bryant](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/directory/jennifer-richmond-bryant). My research project consists of performing spatial and statistical modeling of PM size distribution and concentrations of components including EPFRs to understand the spatial extent of contaminant exposures.

Currently, as a [2022 KC Donnelly award recipient](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/supported/centers/srp/training/donnelly/index.cfm), I'm doing an externship at the Iowa Superfund Research Center. My work in [Dr. Keri Hornbuckle's lab](https://hornbuckle.lab.uiowa.edu/current-projects) focuses on AERMOD predictive modeling to assess exposure to airborne PCBs at the Portland Harbor. 

I also have extensive experience in remote sensing and geographical information systems. My research interests are: spatial statistics, spatial and temporal modeling approaches, sociotechnical systems, and applying these tools to assess air pollution exposure.
